<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Error code &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Not supported</samp>&rsquo; from Dirmngr

<p>Most likely the option <samp class="option">enable-ocsp</samp> is active for gpgsm
but Dirmngr&rsquo;s OCSP feature has not been enabled using
<samp class="option">allow-ocsp</samp> in <samp class="file">dirmngr.conf</samp>.
</p>
</li><li>The Curses based Pinentry does not work

<p>The far most common reason for this is that the environment variable
<code class="code">GPG_TTY</code> has not been set correctly.  Make sure that it has been
set to a real tty device and not just to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/dev/tty</samp>&rsquo;;
i.e. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">GPG_TTY=tty</samp>&rsquo; is plainly wrong; what you want is
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">GPG_TTY=`tty`</samp>&rsquo; &mdash; note the back ticks.  Also make sure that
this environment variable gets exported, that is you should follow up
the setting with an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">export GPG_TTY</samp>&rsquo; (assuming a Bourne style
shell). Even for GUI based Pinentries; you should have set
<code class="code">GPG_TTY</code>. See the section on installing the <code class="command">gpg-agent</code>
on how to do it.
</p>

</li><li>SSH hangs while a popping up pinentry was expected

<p>SSH has no way to tell the gpg-agent what terminal or X display it is
running on.  So when remotely logging into a box where a gpg-agent with
SSH support is running, the pinentry will get popped up on whatever
display the gpg-agent has been started.  To solve this problem you may
issue the command
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent
</pre></div>

<p>and the next pinentry will pop up on your display or screen. However,
you need to kill the running pinentry first because only one pinentry
may be running at once.  If you plan to use ssh on a new display you
should issue the above command before invoking ssh or any other service
making use of ssh.
</p>

</li><li>Exporting a secret key without a certificate

<p>It may happen that you have created a certificate request using
<code class="command">gpgsm</code> but not yet received and imported the certificate from
the CA.  However, you want to export the secret key to another machine
right now to import the certificate over there then.  You can do this
with a little trick but it requires that you know the approximate time
you created the signing request.  By running the command
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  ls -ltr ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d
</pre></div>

<p>you get a listing of all private keys under control of <code class="command">gpg-agent</code>.
Pick the key which best matches the creation time and run the command
</p>
<table class="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  /usr/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-export \
     ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/<var class="var">foo</var> &gt;<var class="var">foo</var>.p12
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>(Please adjust the path to <code class="command">gpg-protect-tool</code> to the appropriate
location). <var class="var">foo</var> is the name of the key file you picked (it should
have the suffix <samp class="file">.key</samp>).  A Pinentry box will pop up and ask you
for the current passphrase of the key and a new passphrase to protect it
in the pkcs#12 file.
</p>
<p>To import the created file on the machine you use this command:
</p>
<table class="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  /usr/libexec/gpg-protect-tool --p12-import --store  <var class="var">foo</var>.p12
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>You will be asked for the pkcs#12 passphrase and a new passphrase to
protect the imported private key at its new location.
</p>
<p>Note that there is no easy way to match existing certificates with
stored private keys because some private keys are used for Secure Shell
or other purposes and don&rsquo;t have a corresponding certificate.
</p>

</li><li>A root certificate does not verify

<p>A common problem is that the root certificate misses the required
basicConstraints attribute and thus <code class="command">gpgsm</code> rejects this
certificate.  An error message indicating &ldquo;no value&rdquo; is a sign for
such a certificate.  You may use the <code class="code">relax</code> flag in
<samp class="file">trustlist.txt</samp> to accept the certificate anyway.  Note that the
fingerprint and this flag may only be added manually to
<samp class="file">trustlist.txt</samp>.
</p>
</li><li>Error message: &ldquo;digest algorithm N has not been enabled&rdquo;

<p>The signature is broken.  You may try the option
<samp class="option">--extra-digest-algo SHA256</samp> to workaround the problem.  The
number N is the internal algorithm identifier; for example 8 refers to
SHA-256.
</p>

</li><li>The Windows version does not work under Wine

<p>When running the W32 version of <code class="command">gpg</code> under Wine you may get
an error messages like:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">gpg: fatal: WriteConsole failed: Access denied
</pre></div>

<p>The solution is to use the command <code class="command">wineconsole</code>.
</p>
<p>Some operations like <samp class="option">--generate-key</samp> really want to talk to
the console directly
for increased security (for example to prevent the passphrase from
appearing on the screen).  So, you should use <code class="command">wineconsole</code>
instead of <code class="command">wine</code>, which will launch a windows console that
implements those additional features.
</p>

</li><li>Why does GPG&rsquo;s &ndash;search-key list weird keys?

<p>For performance reasons the keyservers do not check the keys the same
way <code class="command">gpg</code> does.  It may happen that the listing of keys
available on the keyservers shows keys with wrong user IDs or with user
Ids from other keys.  If you try to import this key, the bad keys or bad
user ids won&rsquo;t get imported, though.  This is a bit unfortunate but we
can&rsquo;t do anything about it without actually downloading the keys.
