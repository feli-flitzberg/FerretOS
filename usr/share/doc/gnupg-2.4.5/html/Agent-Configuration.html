<p>There are a few configuration files needed for the operation of the
agent. By default they may all be found in the current home directory
(see <a class="pxref" href="Agent-Options.html#option-_002d_002dhomedir">option --homedir</a>).
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a id="index-gpg_002dagent_002econf"></a><span><samp class="file">gpg-agent.conf</samp><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-gpg_002dagent_002econf"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard configuration file read by <code class="command">gpg-agent</code> on
  startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading
  two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
  This file is also read after a <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> however only a few
  options will actually have an effect.  This default name may be
  changed on the command line (see <a class="pxref" href="Agent-Options.html#option-_002d_002doptions">option --options</a>).
  You should backup this file.

<dt><a id="index-trustlist_002etxt"></a><span><samp class="file">trustlist.txt</samp><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-trustlist_002etxt"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This is the list of trusted keys.  You should backup this file.
</p>
<p>Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well as empty
  lines are ignored.  To mark a key as trusted you need to enter its
  fingerprint followed by a space and a capital letter <code class="code">S</code>.  Colons
  may optionally be used to separate the bytes of a fingerprint; this
  enables cutting and pasting the fingerprint from a key listing output.  If
  the line is prefixed with a <code class="code">!</code> the key is explicitly marked as
  not trusted.
</p>
<p>Here is an example where two keys are marked as ultimately trusted
  and one as not trusted:
</p>
<table class="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
  A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

<p>Before entering a key into this file, you need to ensure its
authenticity.  How to do this depends on your organisation; your
administrator might have already entered those keys which are deemed
trustworthy enough into this file.  Places where to look for the
fingerprint of a root certificate are letters received from the CA or
the website of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is indeed the
website of that CA).  You may want to consider disallowing interactive
updates of this file by using the <a class="ref" href="Agent-Options.html#option-_002d_002dno_002dallow_002dmark_002dtrusted">option --no-allow-mark-trusted</a>.
It might even be advisable to change the permissions to read-only so
that this file can&rsquo;t be changed inadvertently.
</p>
<p>As a special feature a line <code class="code">include-default</code> will include a global
list of trusted certificates (e.g. <samp class="file">/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt</samp>).
This global list is also used if the local list is not available;
the <a class="ref" href="Agent-Options.html#option-_002d_002dno_002duser_002dtrustlist">option --no-user-trustlist</a> enforces the use of only
this global list.
</p>
<p>It is possible to add further flags after the <code class="code">S</code> for use by the
caller:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><a id="index-relax"></a><span><code class="code">relax</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-relax"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Relax checking of some root certificate requirements.  As of now this
flag allows the use of root certificates with a missing basicConstraints
attribute (despite that it is a MUST for CA certificates) and disables
CRL checking for the root certificate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">cm</code></dt>
<dd><p>If validation of a certificate finally issued by a CA with this flag set
fails, try again using the chain validation model.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">qual</code></dt>
<dd><p>The CA is allowed to issue certificates for qualified signatures.
This flag has an effect only if used in the global list.  This is now
the preferred way to mark such CA; the old way of having a separate
file <samp class="file">qualified.txt</samp> is still supported.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="code">de-vs</code></dt>
<dd><p>The CA is part of an approved PKI for the German classification level
VS-NfD.  It is only valid in the global trustlist.  As of now this is
used only for documentation purpose.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>


</dd>
<dt><a id="index-sshcontrol"></a><span><samp class="file">sshcontrol</samp><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-sshcontrol"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This file is used when support for the secure shell agent protocol has
been enabled (see <a class="pxref" href="Agent-Options.html#option-_002d_002denable_002dssh_002dsupport">option --enable-ssh-support</a>). Only keys present in
this file are used in the SSH protocol.  You should backup this file.
</p>
<p>This file is deprecated in favor of the &quot;Use-for-ssh&quot; attribute in the
key files.
</p>
<p>The <code class="command">ssh-add</code> tool may be used to add new entries to this file;
you may also add them manually.  Comment lines, indicated by a leading
hash mark, as well as empty lines are ignored.  An entry starts with
optional whitespace, followed by the keygrip of the key given as 40 hex
digits, optionally followed by the caching TTL in seconds and another
optional field for arbitrary flags.  A non-zero TTL overrides the global
default as set by <samp class="option">--default-cache-ttl-ssh</samp>.
</p>
<p>The only flag support is <code class="code">confirm</code>.  If this flag is found for a
key, each use of the key will pop up a pinentry to confirm the use of
that key.  The flag is automatically set if a new key was loaded into
<code class="code">gpg-agent</code> using the option <samp class="option">-c</samp> of the <code class="code">ssh-add</code>
command.
</p>
<p>The keygrip may be prefixed with a <code class="code">!</code> to disable an entry.
</p>
<p>The following example lists exactly one key.  Note that keys available
through a OpenPGP smartcard in the active smartcard reader are
implicitly added to this list; i.e. there is no need to list them.

<dd>
<p>This is the directory where gpg-agent stores the private keys.  Each
  key is stored in a file with the name made up of the keygrip and the
  suffix <samp class="file">key</samp>.  You should backup all files in this directory
  and take great care to keep this backup closed away.
</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined
files into the directory <samp class="file">/etc/skel/.gnupg</samp> so that newly created
users start up with a working configuration.  For existing users the
a small helper script is provided to create these files (see <a class="pxref" href="addgnupghome.html">Create .gnupg home directories</a>).
