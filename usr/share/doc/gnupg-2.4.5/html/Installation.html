<h2 class="chapter" id="A-short-installation-guide"><span>1 A short installation guide<a class="copiable-link" href="#A-short-installation-guide"> &para;</a></span></h2>

<p>Unfortunately the installation guide has not been finished in time.
Instead of delaying the release of GnuPG 2.0 even further, I decided to
release without that guide.  The chapter on gpg-agent and gpgsm do
include brief information on how to set up the whole thing.  Please
watch the GnuPG website for updates of the documentation.  In the
meantime you may search the GnuPG mailing list archives or ask on the
gnupg-users mailing list for advise on how to solve problems or how to
get that whole thing up and running.
</p>
<p>** Building the software
</p>
<p>Building the software is described in the file <samp class="file">INSTALL</samp>.  Given
that you are already reading this documentation we can only give some
extra hints.
</p>
<p>To comply with the rules on GNU systems you should have build time
configured <code class="command">gnupg</code> using:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
</pre></div>

<p>This is to make sure that system wide configuration files are searched
in the directory <samp class="file">/etc</samp> and variable data below <samp class="file">/var</samp>;
the default would be to also install them below <samp class="file">/usr/local</samp> where
the binaries get installed.  If you selected to use the
<samp class="option">--prefix=/</samp> you obviously don&rsquo;t need those option as they are
the default then.
</p>

<p>** Notes on setting a root CA key to trusted
</p>
<p>X.509 is based on a hierarchical key infrastructure.  At the root of the
tree a trusted anchor (root certificate) is required.  There are usually
no other means of verifying whether this root certificate is trustworthy
than looking it up in a list. GnuPG uses a file (<samp class="file">trustlist.txt</samp>)
to keep track of all root certificates it knows about.  There are 3 ways
to get certificates into this list:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Use the list which comes with GnuPG. However this list only
contains a few root certificates.  Most installations will need more.

</li><li>Let <code class="command">gpgsm</code> ask you whether you want to insert a new root
certificate.  This feature is enabled by default; you may disable it
using the option <samp class="option">no-allow-mark-trusted</samp> into
<samp class="file">gpg-agent.conf</samp>.

</li><li>Manually maintain the list of trusted root certificates. For a multi
user installation this can be done once for all users on a machine.
Specific changes on a per-user base are also possible.
</li></ul>
