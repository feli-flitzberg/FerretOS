<p>GnuPG has been developed on GNU/Linux systems and is know to work on
almost all Free OSes.  All modern POSIX systems should be supported
right now, however there are probably a lot of smaller glitches we need
to fix first.  The major problem areas are:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>We are planning to use file descriptor passing for interprocess
communication.  This will allow us save a lot of resources and improve
performance of certain operations a lot.  Systems not supporting this
won&rsquo;t gain these benefits but we try to keep them working the standard
way as it is done today.

</li><li>We require more or less full POSIX compatibility.  This has been
around for 15 years now and thus we don&rsquo;t believe it makes sense to
support non POSIX systems anymore.  Well, we of course the usual
workarounds for near POSIX systems well be applied.

<p>There is one exception of this rule: Systems based the Microsoft Windows
API (called here <em class="emph">W32</em>) will be supported to some extend.
</p>
</li></ul>
