.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP is used to generate code and/or documentation for one or more
D\-Bus interfaces.
.sp
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP reads
D\-Bus Introspection XML <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#introspection-format>

from files passed as additional arguments on the command line and generates
output files. It currently supports generating C source code (via \fB\-\-body\fP) or
header (via \fB\-\-header\fP) and DocBook XML (via \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP).
Alternatively, more restricted C source code and headers can be generated, which
just contain the interface information (as \fBGDBusInterfaceInfo\fP structures)
using \fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP and \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP\&.
.SH GENERATING C CODE
.sp
When generating C code, a \fBGInterface\fP derived type is generated for each
D\-Bus interface. Additionally, for every generated type, \fBFooBar\fP, two
concrete instantiatable types, \fBFooBarProxy\fP and \fBFooBarSkeleton\fP,
implementing said interface are also generated. The former is derived from
\fBGDBusProxy\fP and intended for use on the client side while the latter is
derived from the \fBGDBusInterfaceSkeleton\fP type making it easy to export on a
\fBGDBusConnection\fP either directly or via a \fBGDBusObjectManagerServer\fP
instance.
.sp
For C code generation either \fB\-\-body\fP that generates source code, \fB\-\-header\fP
that generates headers, \fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP that generates interface
information source code, or \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP that generates interface
information headers, can be used. These options must be used along with
\fB\-\-output\fP, which is used to specify the file to output to.
.sp
Both files can be generated at the same time by using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, but
this option is deprecated. In this case \fB\-\-output\fP cannot be used due to the
generation of multiple files. Instead pass \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP to specify the
directory to put the output files in. By default the current directory will be
used.
.sp
The name of each generated C type is derived from the D\-Bus interface name
stripped with the prefix given with \fB\-\-interface\-prefix\fP and with the dots
removed and initial characters capitalized. For example, for the D\-Bus
interface \fBcom.acme.Coyote\fP the name used is \fBComAcmeCoyote\fP\&. For the D\-Bus
interface \fBorg.project.Bar.Frobnicator\fP with \fB\-\-interface\-prefix\fP set to
\fBorg.project.\fP, the name used is \fBBarFrobnicator\fP\&.
.sp
For methods, signals and properties, if not specified, the name defaults to the
name of the method, signal or property.
.sp
Two forms of the name are used — the CamelCase form and the lower\-case form. The
CamelCase form is used for the \fBGType\fP and struct name, while lower\-case form
is used in function names. The lower\-case form is calculated by converting from
CamelCase to lower\-case and inserting underscores at word boundaries (using
certain heuristics).
.sp
If the value given by the \fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.Name\fP annotation or the
\fB\-\-c\-namespace\fP option contains an underscore (sometimes called \fIUgly_Case\fP),
then the camel\-case name is derived by removing all underscores, and the
lower\-case name is derived by lower\-casing the string. This is useful in some
situations where abbreviations are used. For example, if the annotation is used
on the interface \fBnet.MyCorp.MyApp.iSCSITarget\fP with the value
\fBiSCSI_Target\fP the CamelCase form is \fBiSCSITarget\fP while the lower\-case form
is \fBiscsi_target\fP\&. If the annotation is used on the method \fBEjectTheiPod\fP
with the value \fBEject_The_iPod\fP, the lower\-case form is \fBeject_the_ipod\fP\&.
.SH GENERATING DOCBOOK DOCUMENTATION
.sp
Each generated DocBook XML file (see the \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP option for
details) is a \fBRefEntry\fP article describing the D\-Bus interface. (See the
DocBook documentation <https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/4.5/refentry.html>
\&.)
.SH GENERATING RESTRUCTUREDTEXT DOCUMENTATION
.sp
Each generated reStructuredText file (see the \fB\-\-generate\-rst\fP option for
details) is a plain text
reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>
 document
describing the D\-Bus interface.

in. By default the current directory will be used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-rst\fP \fIOUTFILES\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Generate C code for all D\-Bus interfaces and put it in \fBOUTFILES.c\fP and
\fBOUTFILES.h\fP including any sub\-directories. If you want the files to be
output in a different location use \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP as \fBOUTFILES.h\fP
including sub\-directories will be referenced from \fBOUTFILES.c\fP\&.
.sp
The full paths would then be
\fB$(OUTDIR)/$(dirname $OUTFILES)/$(basename $OUTFILES).{c,h}\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-c\-namespace\fP \fIYourProject\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-c\-generate\-object\-manager\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If this option is passed, suitable \fBGDBusObject\fP, \fBGDBusObjectProxy\fP,

generated for. \fBnone\fP means to not generate any autocleanup functions.
\fBobjects\fP means to generate them for object types, and \fBall\fP means to
generate them for object types and interfaces. The default is \fBobjects\fP
due to a corner case in backwards compatibility with a few projects,
but you should likely switch your project to use \fBall\fP\&.
This option was added in GLib 2.50.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-output\-directory\fP \fIOUTDIR\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Directory to output generated source to. Equivalent to changing directory
before generation.
.sp
This option cannot be used with \fB\-\-body\fP, \fB\-\-header\fP,

must be used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-header\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If this option is passed, it will generate the header code and write it to the
disk by using the path and file name provided by \fB\-\-output\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP or \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP
are not allowed to be used along with \fB\-\-header\fP and \fB\-\-body\fP options,
because these options are used to generate only one file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-body\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If this option is passed, it will generate the source code and write it to the
disk by using the path and file name provided by \fB\-\-output\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP or \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP
are not allowed to be used along with \fB\-\-header\fP and \fB\-\-body\fP options,

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If this option is passed, it will generate the header code for the
\fBGDBusInterfaceInfo\fP structures only and will write it to the disk by using
the path and file name provided by \fB\-\-output\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP or \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP
are not allowed to be used along with the \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP and
\fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP options, because these options are used to generate
only one file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If this option is passed, it will generate the source code for the
\fBGDBusInterfaceInfo\fP structures only and will write it to the disk by using
the path and file name provided by \fB\-\-output\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP or \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP
are not allowed to be used along with the \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP and
\fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP options, because these options are used to generate
only one file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\fP \fIDECORATOR\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a \fBDECORATOR\fP is passed in with this option, all the generated function
prototypes in the generated header will be marked with \fBDECORATOR\fP\&. This can
be used, for instance, to export symbols from code generated with
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP\&.
.sp
This option was added in GLib 2.66.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\-header\fP \fIHEADER\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a \fBHEADER\fP is passed in with this option, the generated header will put a
\fB#include HEADER\fP before the rest of the items, except for the inclusion
guards or \fB#pragma once\fP (if \fB\-\-pragma\-once\fP is used).  This is used if
using another header file is needed for the decorator passed in via
\fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\fP to be defined.
.sp
This option was added in GLib 2.66.
.sp
This option can only be used if \fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\fP is used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\-define\fP \fIDEFINE\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a \fBDEFINE\fP is passed in with this option, the generated source will add a
\fB#define DEFINE\fP before the rest of the items.  This is used if a particular
macro is needed to ensure the decorator passed in via \fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\fP
uses the correct definition when the generated source is being compiled.
.sp
This option was added in GLib 2.66.
.sp
This option can only be used if \fB\-\-symbol\-decorator\fP is used.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-output\fP \fIOUTFILE\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The full path where the header (\fB\-\-header\fP, \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP) or
the source code (\fB\-\-body\fP, \fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP) will be written, using
the path and filename provided by \fB\-\-output\fP\&. The full path could be
something like \fB$($OUTFILE).{c,h}\fP\&.
.sp
Using \fB\-\-generate\-c\-code\fP, \fB\-\-generate\-docbook\fP or \fB\-\-output\-directory\fP
is not allowed along with \fB\-\-output\fP, because the latter is used to generate
only one file.
.sp
Since GLib 2.80, if \fIOUTFILE\fP is the literal string \fB\-\fP, the header
or source code will be written to standard output.
.sp
For \fB\-\-body\fP and \fB\-\-interface\-info\-body\fP, the generated code will not
automatically \fB#include\fP a corresponding header file when writing to
standard output, because there is no obvious name for that header file.
This might make it necessary to use \fBcc \-include foo.h\fP, or generate a
filename like \fBfoo\-impl.h\fP and \fB#include\fP it into a wrapper \fB\&.c\fP file.
.sp
For \fB\-\-header\fP and \fB\-\-interface\-info\-header\fP, there is no obvious
name for a traditional multiple\-inclusion guard when writing to standard
output, so using the \fB\-\-pragma\-once\fP option is recommended.
.sp
In the rare situation that the intended output filename starts with \fB\-\fP,
it should be prefixed with \fB\&./\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-glib\-min\-required\fP \fIVERSION\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the minimum version of GLib which the code generated by
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP can depend on. This may be used to make
backwards\-incompatible changes in the output or behaviour of \fBgdbus\-codegen\fP
in future, which users may opt in to by increasing the value they pass for
\fB\-\-glib\-min\-required\fP\&. If this option is not passed, the output from
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP is guaranteed to be compatible with all versions of GLib
from 2.30 upwards, as that is when \fBgdbus\-codegen\fP was first released.
.sp
Note that some version parameters introduce incompatible changes: all callers
of the generated code might need to be updated, and if the generated code is
part of a library’s API or ABI, then increasing the version parameter can
result in an API or ABI break.
.sp
The version number must be of the form \fBMAJOR.MINOR.MICRO\fP, where all parts
are integers. \fBMINOR\fP and \fBMICRO\fP are optional. The version number may not
be smaller than \fB2.30\fP\&.
.sp
If the version number is \fB2.64\fP or greater, the generated code will
have the following features:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
If a method has \fBh\fP (file descriptor) parameter(s), a \fBGUnixFDList\fP
parameter will exist in the generated code for it (whereas previously the
annotation \fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.UnixFD\fP was required), and
.IP 2. 3
Method call functions will have two additional arguments to allow the user
to specify \fBGDBusCallFlags\fP and a timeout value, as is possible when
using \fBg_dbus_proxy_call()\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-glib\-max\-allowed\fP \fIVERSION\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the maximum version of GLib which the code generated by
\fBgdbus\-codegen\fP can depend on. This may be used to ensure that code
generated by \fBgdbus\-codegen\fP is compilable with specific older versions of
GLib that your software has to support.
.sp
The version number must be of the form \fBMAJOR.MINOR.MICRO\fP, where all parts
are integers. \fBMINOR\fP and \fBMICRO\fP are optional. The version number must be
greater than or equal to that passed to \fB\-\-glib\-min\-required\fP\&.
It defaults to the version of GLib which provides this \fBgdbus\-codegen\fP\&.

.SH SUPPORTED D-BUS ANNOTATIONS
.sp
The following D\-Bus annotations are supported by \fBgdbus\-codegen\fP:
.sp
\fBorg.freedesktop.DBus.Deprecated\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Can be used on any \fB<interface>\fP, \fB<method>\fP, \fB<signal>\fP and
\fB<property>\fP element to specify that the element is deprecated if its value
is \fBtrue\fP\&. Note that this annotation is defined in the
D\-Bus specification <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#introspection-format>

and can only assume the values \fBtrue\fP and \fBfalse\fP\&. In particular, you
cannot specify the version that the element was deprecated in nor any helpful
deprecation message. Such information should be added to the element
documentation instead.
.sp
When generating C code, this annotation is used to add \fBG_GNUC_DEPRECATED\fP
to generated functions for the element.
.sp
When generating DocBook XML, a deprecation warning will appear along the
documentation for the element.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.Since\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Can be used on any \fB<interface>\fP, \fB<method>\fP, \fB<signal>\fP and
\fB<property>\fP element to specify the version (any free\-form string but
compared using a version\-aware sort function) the element appeared in.
.sp
When generating C code, this field is used to ensure
function pointer order for preserving ABI/API, see ‘STABILITY GUARANTEES’.
.sp
When generating DocBook XML, the value of this tag appears in the
documentation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.DocString\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.Name\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Can be used on any \fB<interface>\fP, \fB<method>\fP, \fB<signal>\fP and
\fB<property>\fP element to specify the name to use when generating C code. The
value is expected to be in
CamelCase <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case>
 or \fIUgly_Case\fP (see
above).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.ForceGVariant\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to a non\-empty string, a \fBGVariant\fP instance will be used instead of
the natural C type. This annotation can be used on any \fB<arg>\fP and
\fB<property>\fP element.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.UnixFD\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Note that \fB@since\fP can be used in any inline documentation bit (e.g. for
interfaces, methods, signals and properties) to set the \fBorg.gtk.GDBus.Since\fP
annotation. For the \fBorg.gtk.GDBus.DocString\fP annotation (and inline
comments), note that substrings of the form \fB#net.Corp.Bar\fP,
\fBnet.Corp.Bar.FooMethod()\fP, \fB#net.Corp.Bar::BarSignal\fP and
\fB#net.Corp.InlineDocs:BazProperty\fP are all expanded to links to the respective
interface, method, signal and property. Additionally, substrings starting with
\fB@\fP and \fB%\fP characters are rendered as

Thus, for every D\-Bus method, there will be three C functions for calling the
method, one \fBGObject\fP signal for handling an incoming call and one C function
for completing an incoming call. For every D\-Bus signal, there’s one \fBGObject\fP
signal and one C function for emitting it. For every D\-Bus property, two C
functions are generated (one setter, one getter) and one \fBGObject\fP property.

Instead of using the generic \fBGDBusProxy\fP facilities, one can use the
generated methods such as \fBmy_app_frobber_call_hello_world()\fP to invoke
the \fBnet.Corp.MyApp.Frobber.HelloWorld()\fP D\-Bus method, connect to the
\fB::notification\fP \fBGObject\fP signal to receive the
\fBnet.Corp.MyApp.Frobber::Notification\fP D\-Bus signal and get/set the
\fBnet.Corp.MyApp.Frobber:Verbose\fP D\-Bus Property using either the \fBGObject\fP
property \fB:verbose\fP or the \fBmy_app_get_verbose()\fP and
\fBmy_app_set_verbose()\fP methods. Use the standard \fBGObject::notify\fP signal to
listen to property changes.
.sp
Note that all property access is via the \fBGDBusProxy\fP property cache so no I/O
is ever done when reading properties. Also note that setting a property will
cause the \fBorg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set\fP method
(documentation <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-properties>
)
to be called on the remote object. This call, however, is asynchronous so
setting a property won’t block. Further, the change is delayed and no error
checking is possible.
.SS Server\-side usage
.sp
The generated \fBMyAppFrobber\fP interface is designed so it is easy to implement
it in a \fBGObject\fP subclass. For example, to handle \fBHelloWorld()\fP method
invocations, set the vfunc for \fBhandle_hello_hello_world()\fP in the
\fBMyAppFrobberIface\fP structure. Similarly, to handle the
\fBnet.Corp.MyApp.Frobber:Verbose\fP property override the \fB:verbose\fP
\fBGObject\fP property from the subclass. To emit a signal, use e.g.
\fBmy_app_emit_signal()\fP or \fBg_signal_emit_by_name()\fP\&.
.sp
Instead of subclassing, it is often easier to use the generated
\fBMyAppFrobberSkeleton\fP subclass. To handle incoming method calls, use
\fBg_signal_connect()\fP with the \fB::handle\-*\fP signals and instead of
overriding the \fBget_property()\fP and \fBset_property()\fP vfuncs from
\fBGObject\fP, use \fBg_object_get()\fP and \fBg_object_set()\fP or the generated
property getters and setters (the generated class has an internal property bag
implementation).

To facilitate atomic changesets (multiple properties changing at the same time),
\fBGObject::notify\fP signals are queued up when received. The queue is drained in
an idle handler (which is called from the thread\-default main loop of the thread
where the skeleton object was constructed) and will cause emissions of the
\fBorg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged\fP
(documentation <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-properties>
)
signal with all the properties that have changed. Use
\fBg_dbus_interface_skeleton_flush()\fP or \fBg_dbus_object_skeleton_flush()\fP to
empty the queue immediately. Use \fBg_object_freeze_notify()\fP and
\fBg_object_thaw_notify()\fP for atomic changesets if on a different thread.
.SH C TYPE MAPPING
.sp
Scalar types (type strings \fBb\fP, \fBy\fP, \fBn\fP, \fBq\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBu\fP, \fBx\fP,
\fBt\fP and \fBd\fP), strings (type strings \fBs\fP, \fBay\fP, \fBo\fP and \fBg\fP) and
arrays of strings (type strings \fBas\fP, \fBao\fP and \fBaay\fP) are mapped to the
natural types, e.g. \fBgboolean\fP, \fBgdouble\fP, \fBgint\fP, \fBgchar*\fP, \fBgchar**\fP
and so on. Everything else is mapped to the \fBGVariant\fP type.
.sp
This automatic mapping can be turned off by using the annotation
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.C.ForceGVariant\fP — if used then a \fBGVariant\fP is always
exchanged instead of the corresponding native C type. This annotation may be
convenient to use when using bytestrings (type string \fBay\fP) for data that
could have embedded nul bytes.
.SH STABILITY GUARANTEES
.sp
The generated C functions are guaranteed to not change their ABI. That is, if a
method, signal or property does not change its signature in the introspection
XML, the generated C functions will not change their C ABI either. The ABI of
the generated instance and class structures will be preserved as well.
.sp
The ABI of the generated \fBGType\fP instances will be preserved only if the
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.Since\fP annotation is used judiciously — this is because the
VTable for the \fBGInterface\fP relies on function pointers for signal handlers.
Specifically, if a D\-Bus method, property or signal or is added to a D\-Bus
interface, then ABI of the generated \fBGInterface\fP type is preserved if, and
only if, each added method, property signal is annotated with the
\fBorg.gtk.GDBus.Since\fP annotation using a greater version number than previous
versions.
.sp
The generated C code currently happens to be annotated with
gtk\-doc <https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtk-doc-manual/stable/>
 and
GObject Introspection <https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
 comments and
annotations. The layout and contents might change in the future so no guarantees
about e.g. \fBSECTION\fP usage etc. are given.
.sp
While the generated DocBook for D\-Bus interfaces isn’t expected to change, no
guarantees are given at this point.
.sp
It is important to note that the generated code should not be checked into
version control systems, nor it should be included in distributed source
archives.
