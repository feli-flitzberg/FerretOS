.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgresource\fP offers a simple commandline interface to \fBGResource\fP\&. It lets
you list and extract resources that have been compiled into a resource file or
included in an ELF file (a binary or a shared library).
.sp
The file to operate on is specified by the \fBFILE\fP argument.
.sp
If an ELF file includes multiple sections with resources, it is possible to
select which one to operate on with the \fB\-\-section\fP option. Use the
\fBsections\fP command to find available sections.
